About me
</h2>
I am a master student currently in the Stage II of the <a href= https://www.ices.utexas.edu/graduate-studies/cs-and-csem-joint-degree/ target="new">BS CS/MS CSEM 5-year master program</a>, which held jointly by 
</br>the <a href = "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> and the <a href="http://www.ices.utexas.edu/">Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences</a>.
</br>
Before that,
I was a student pursuing Bachelor of Science in <a href = "http://www.ma.utexas.edu/">Mathematics</a> from Spring 2014 to Fall 2017 in UT.
</br>I plan to finish all Bachelor and Master degrees by Spring 2019.
</br>
</p>

</br>In the Academia setting, my interest lies on numerical analysis and interpretation of the data. 
</br>In spring and summer 2016, I worked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number">condition number</a> estimation under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rvdg">Robert A. van de Geijn</a>.
</br>The poster is <a href="./works/2016posterprint.pdf">here</a>, the report is <a href="./works/report.pdf">here</a> and the code is <a href=https://github.com/henear/cond_estimation>here</a>.
</p>
<p>
</br> In the Industrial setting, I would like to work on cloud computings and the application of big data on it.
</br> In summer 2017, I worked with <a href=https://www.cisco.com/> Cisco Systems</a> on the Spark Alarming system in the data team in Richardson, TX as a software engineer intern.
